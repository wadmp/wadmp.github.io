# Signup and create your company

To start using WebAccess DMP you need a user first. This applies only if you are the first from your company to access the plattform. If someone else already Signed Up, ask him or her to create a user to add you to the company. Signing Up will also ask you to create a company. This will allow you later to claim your devices.

These are the steps if you prefer instructions instead of a video:
- Go to [wadmp.com](https://wadmp.com). You will be redirected to the login page
- Click on the Sign Up link and fill your details and the ones of your company
- After clicking on the Sign Up button go to your email inbox and confirm your new user.
