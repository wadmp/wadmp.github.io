# Sign Up and create your company
To start using WebAccess DMP you need first to have a user. This applies only if you are the first from your company to access the plattform. If someone else already Signed Up, ask him or her to create your user and add you to the company.
Signing Up will also ask you to create a company. This will allow you later to claim your devices.

Welcome. In this video we will create our user in order to access the plattform. This is only necessary if you are the first in your company accessing the plattform. Sign Up will also ask you to create a company where you will have all permissions, so if other person already signed up, you both will be in different companies and not able to share devices.

Let's go ahead and open wadmp.com. We are redirected to the login screen. At the bottom we have a Sign Up link. We fill the form with our details and we press next. Here we are presented with the fields for our company. As we said before, we will have all permissions on this new company, so later we can create new users and add them to the company.
The primary contact is the person responsible for the company. We can fill those details if it's not me, but in this case we well leave it ticked. I will press Sign Up and I get the message "An email was sent to you", so let's go to my email. Here it is. This step confirms my email address when I click on it. Now I am confirmed and also logged in to the plattform, so if I go to the dashboard, I will be redirected without re-authenticating.
Of course, I still have no devices nor other users. You can see more about it in the following videos.
