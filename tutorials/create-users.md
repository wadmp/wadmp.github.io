# Create users

All users are identified by their email address.
The only way to add users to your companies is by creating them yourself. If a user signs up a company will be created for him, one with no relation with yours.

Welcome. In this video we will see how to create a new user on the plattform and how permissions work.
This is a workflow you'll follow often, as is the only way to add a user to your company. If a user signs up a company will be created for him, one with no relation with your companies, so he won't be accessible to you to add him to your companies.

First of all let's follow the user creation workflow. We need to go to Users. The only user here will be you. Now click on the add user icon. Now we fill the name and email of the new user. Any address that looks like an email will be accepted, but to validate the address an email will be sent, so if your address is not correct or real, the user will never be able to login.
I'll add my address so we can activate the user later. We also need to add the user to at least one company. If a user does not belong to any company it won't be visible to you anywhere in the plattform, and you won't be able to create another user with the same email.
So we select the company we want and we see the section of user permissions is show below. As it is we could create the user by clicking on save, the user won't have permission to do anything on the plattform. Not too useful really, so we better add some permissions.
As you may guess by the name of the user, I want this user to be an Installer, to have all possible permissions over the devices of this company. So in the devices section I will allow the user to view, claim and edit devices. He won't be able to do anything with Users, Companies, Applications or Manufacturing. You may have noticed I haven't checked the delete devices permissions. This is because an installer won't need to delete devices from the plattform, only claim and maybe unclaim them. Also delete devices is a permission I don't have, that no user that signed up has, and we cannot give a user a permission we don't have.
Let's create the user then and go to my mails. Here it is the confirmation email. I will open this link on an Incognito window, as the browser is already logged with my own user. This last step allows me to add a password. And now my user is activated. If I try to access sections I have not permissions for, I get an error as you can see.
We were talking about claiming a device. We will talk a bit more about that in the next video.
