# Create more Users

In order to Create a new User, you must have the authority to Create a User. 

User creation depends on 2 User criterion: 

User Authentication (successful login) is the first: User Authorisation (permissions) is the second. 

To check the user-permissions that you have, you may select your username from the Users list.

Your assigned permissions are shown as green dots.

e.g.

Assuming you have the required permissions, you may create a new User by following these steps: 

1. Select "Users" from the Context menu. 
2. On the Actions bar, click on the "Create User" action button.

3. On the prompt that follows, enter the following criteria: 

   1. First Name and Last Name of the User that you are creating. 

   2. Valid email address for the User that you are creating. 

      **Note**: This email address **must** be valid. The user will receive an emailed verification request from the Platform, and must click on the link that has been emailed to them in order to create and verify their Authentication credentials.

   3. Select one or more Company that you wish to Authorise this User to interact with.

      **Note**: After you have selected one or more Company, you must assign permissions to that User on a granular basis.

   4. Assign the appropriate Permissions for the User you are creating, for each of the Companies that you wish them to be able to interact with. 

      **Note**: By default, there are **no Permissions** granted, for a new User, in any Company. There must be a deliberate action to assign Permissions, per Company, to this User. 
   
      **Note**: You may only create a new User in Companies that you are authorised to create Users in.
   
      **Note**: You may only assign a Permissions to a new User, for a Company, if you have that Permission yourself. 
   
   5. Save.
