# Create a new Company

In order to Create a new Company, you must have the authority to Create a Company. 

Company creation depends on 2 User criterion: 

User Authentication (successful login) is the first: User Authorisation (permissions) is the second. 

To check the user-permissions that you have, you may select your username from the Users list.

Your assigned permissions are shown as green dots.

e.g.

Assuming you have the required permissions, you may create a new Company by following these steps: 

1. Select "Companies" from the Context menu. 
2. On the Actions bar, click on the "create company" action button.

3. On the prompt that follows, enter the following information: 

   1. Name of the Company that you are creating. 

   2. Select the Parent Company for this Company (this is required)

      Note: if you are an authorised user in more than one Company, you can select which of those Companies should be the Parent for this new Company.

   3. Enter the business address for this new Company.

   4. Enter the name, phone number and email address for the person who will be the Primary Contact person in this new Company. 

      Note: this information is "meta data": this step does _not_ create a User in the system, nor does it assign a User any permissions for this new Company. 

   5. Save.
