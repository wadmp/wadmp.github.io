# Create new companies
You can create more companies to represent a logical subdivision made for practical purposes. You may want to create a new company under your organization with different devices because:

You want your devices to be managed by different users
You want one aggregated dashboard per device group
It makes sense for the structure to resemble the hierarchy of your organization. e.g. Buildings or Areas where devices are installed
Go to Companies on the left menu and click on the icon for a new company, on the left of the page menu. Select a parent company to represent the hierarchy between them.

Remember the creation of a company depends on two conditions:
- That you can login to the platform and
- That you have permissions to create companies

If you can't see the new company icon, contact the admin of your company to get the appropiate permissions.
You can check your permissions if you edit your user. Your assigned permissions are shown as green dots.

As a summary, these are the fields you have to fill when creating a new company: 

1. Name of the Company that you are creating. 

2. Parent Company for this Company (this is required)

   Note: if you are an authorised user in more than one Company, you can select which of those Companies should be the Parent for this new Company.

3. Business address for this new Company.

4. Name, phone number and email address for the person who will be the Primary Contact person in this new Company. 

   Note: this information is "metadata": this step does _not_ create a User in the system, nor does it assign a User any permissions for this new Company.
