# Create new companies

Only the first company created by you represents your organization. All companies created after represent a logical subdivision made for practical purposes.
You may want to create a new company under your organization if you need to keep separated groups of devices because:
- You want your devices to be managed by different users
- You want one aggregated dashboard per device group
- It makes sense for the structure to resemble the structure of your organication. e.g. Buildings or Areas where devices are installed

At creation select a parent company to represent the hierarchy between them. You can delete a company only if it has a parent.

Welcome. Today we will talk about creating more companies. The process of creation of a new company is pretty straightforward. Once logged in you have to go to Companies and then click on the New Company icon. The form has the same fields we filled when signing up plus a dropdown were we can select a parent company. Let's complete the form for a new company. Now we have to select a parent company. We recommend you to always select a parent, as all new ones depend on your organization. Later you can delete the company, but only because it has a parent. To confirm this, let's create it without a parent and see what happens when we try to delete it. It fails with the message "The company is a root company". So now we need to go to edit the company and select a parent. In this case I want to represent regions where my devices will be installed, so I will make my company a child of the organization one.
There are several reasons why we may need to create new companies. Let's suppose we have a work pipeline where we assign groups of devices temporarily to installers for initial configuration and then want them accessible only to administrators. So we create the company Installers, and assign the installers only there. Now we can claim the device to the Installers company and reclaim them to the geographical region later. Of course this is only an example of the many layouts we can make, depending on the needs of our organization.
Aggregated dashboards will give you information about all devices on a company. This is another reason to have devices grouped in different companies.

We touched superficially user permissions on a company. This is a whole other topic, so if you want some more information about it please check the next tutorial.
