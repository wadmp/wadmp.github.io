## WebAccess/DMP version 2.4.0: 13th December 2021

### User Interface

#### Features:

* There is a new **Alert** feature available. Alerts allow users to observe specific parameters of a single device or a company and set notification triggers based on its values. The Alert feature is only available for Premium accounts.

* The **Auditing** feature - gives a User possibility to discover records over 70 parameters of a single device, users, and the WADMP application. Full Auditing records are available under the new menu item - Audit Logs. The Device logs are located at the Device page on the tab Audit Logs. The User-related records can be found on the “Audit Logs” tab in the Users section.

* Added reboot button and upgrade firmware button for a single device (on the right on device detail page):

![reboot upgrade delete](/images/release-notes/2.4.0_reboot_upgrade_delete.png "reboot upgrade delete")

* As we now support soft delete of the device, the icon to delete is shown at all times at the device (showed previously at unclaimed devices only).

#### Improvements:

* In login web we removed the redundant "Remember Me" checkbox (this is enabled by default), changed forgot password success/error message to improve security (it is harder to guess user email address now), corrected some formatting.

* User edit form was changed to on-page form (previously modal dialog) for better readability and usability. Also, confusing error placement was changed to a popup message.

* Two state filters on the "My Devices" page (online/offline, claimed/unclaimed, in-sync) now have green color for positive selection so it is clear what state they are in.

* Added EULA and Privacy policy popup dialog to record user agreements. 

* Aggregated Router Apps were hidden from the installation menu (these apps will be installed automatically when the parent app is installed).

* Empty tag filter at devices now shows an empty message and does not look weird.

#### Maintenance:

Upgraded some Node.js packages

#### Bugfixes:

* Fixed password check at signup/password change so all special characters can be used.

* Fixed counts of online/offline devices on Dashboard (related to MQTT fix) 

* Added missing Back button to Create new playbook form.

* Fixed rendering of initials icons (company, user, ...) that were broken when input contained more spaces between words.

* Fixed the Connectivity History graph in Grafana Company Dashboard that was not showing correctly.

* Added missing error message for Company Contact Email on the sign-up form.
  
* Added some missing input length checks on login web forms.

* Fixed "Value is not an integer" error at the device configuration.

* Added missing length validation (settings group).

* Saving of device configuration now shows a real error message from the server.
