## WebAccess/DMP version 2.4.2: February 8, 2022

This is a mostly bugfixing release that addresses several issues that have been present for some time now. 

### Improvements:

* **UI: Reworked the device table at the Company Dashboard page** (it now contains links to the pages of the respective devices and is sortable by column).

* **Added several major optimization measures that improve the performance of our database.**

* UI: Removed the Device Type graph from the Company Dashboard page due to it being redundant (it is also available on the Aggregated Dashboard page).

* UI: Improved formatting of the extendable device detail information available at the "My Devices" page and at device pages.

### Bugfixes:

* **Fixed routers sometimes become stuck out of sync due to a message being lost and the server not resending it.**

* Fixed Auditing pages by default not including the records created in the past 1 minute.

* Fixed records in the Alert History page not being sorted by time.

* Fixed some auditing records missing Requester User and Company Name information.

* Fixed e-mails about Alerts showing slightly wrong time (delayed by the length of Cooldown). We also added information about the timezone (UTC) into the messages.
