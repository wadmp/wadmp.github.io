* **The *Install Router Apps* section has been improved**:

  1. Router Apps are now sorted alphabetically. The sorting order can be changed.
  2. Added a search box to find a Router App quickly.
  3. *CANCEL* and *INSTALL* buttons are always visible.
  4. Removed the *mark all apps* checkbox.

* The icons of the *Playbooks* and *Audit Logs Action Type* filters changed to a classic filter icon.

* Changed the data amount unit symbol from MBs to MiBs everywhere in the GUI, so the data units are unified (1 MiB is counted as 1024 KiBs).

* Removed the Breadcrumb panels on the top of the pages.
![Panel Removal](/images/release-notes/panel-removal.png "Panel Removal") 

* Added the text "Press ESC for more options" to the Company dashboard, so the graph tunning settings can be found easier.
![Escape Options](/images/release-notes/escape-options.png "Escape Options") 

*  The Premium label at the Alerts menu now disappears once the user is a member of Premium companies only.

* Added spaces to the Alert Rule *Operators* so they are more human-readable.

### Bugfixes:
 
* Fixed multiple visual bugs and details: alignments, cropped company filter pills, unified bold text usage, and added missing description tooltips.

* Fixed visual bug of the Invoice PDF that it did not have alignment borders. 

* Alerts: Fixed *Target Type* not being changed when switching between *Single Device* and *Company* values, despite the successful message being shown.

* Alerts: Fixed the device selection was offering devices that do not belong to the selected company.
  
* Auditing: Fixed an issue where some events did not show because the minute accurate time filter wrongly did not include them. The time filter shows events in all 59 seconds of the selected minute.

* Playbooks: Fixed showing of Router Apps with is_aggreagate parameter set to true. These Routers Apps are now not offered to be installed but are automatically installed along with other Router App.
