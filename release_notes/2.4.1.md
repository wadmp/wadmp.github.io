## WebAccess/DMP version 2.4.1: January 14 2022

### User Interface

#### Improvements:

* Alerts now allow the use of float numbers in the rule value field, so the evaluation can be more precise (it was integer before).
  
* A pagination option for 100 entries was added to all places in UI.

* Permission to delete devices is now given as default for all newly added Company Admins. Note that this does apply only for newly created Company Admins, permissions of already existing users are not affected in any way.

#### Bugfixes:

* Fixed users with 20+ companies experienced an issue with sign-in. This was caused by JWT token length. The length of the token was decreased significantly.

* Fixed avatar icons that showed more than 2 letters. Now only the first letters of the first two words are shown.

### Code / API

* Fixed the DEVICE_RELEASE action type in Auditing that was missing a company ID.

* Fixed handling exception on API dashboard endpoint (/monitoring/devices/dashboard-statistics)
