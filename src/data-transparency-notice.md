# WebAccess/DMP Data Act

DATA TRANSPARENCY NOTICE

This statement is provided in accordance with the EU Data Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/2854), which establishes obligations for manufacturers and data holders to ensure users have transparent access to information about data collected, processed, and stored from connected devices and related services.

## 1. Data Collected

WADMP receives and stores data generated by connected devices (routers). This includes in particular:
- **Device identity and metadata** (serial number, model, firmware version, configuration parameters).
- **Operational telemetry** (status, session details, connectivity, performance metrics, and measurements).
- **Location and communication data** (if enabled on the device, such as GPS coordinates).

In principle, any information collected and available in the router may be reported and stored in WADMP.

## 2. Purpose of Processing

- WADMP does not use device data for its own commercial purposes.
- Data is collected and stored **exclusively for the customerâ€™s use**.
- Advantech never uses customer data for analytics, development, or marketing unless the data has first been **anonymized or aggregated**, or unless the customer has given **explicit consent**.
- Customers decide how to access, analyze, share, or further process their own data.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- **Configuration data** (device settings, parameters) is stored for as long as the customer account exists.
- **Monitoring and telemetry data history** (status, logs, metrics) is stored for **90 days**. After this period, it is automatically deleted unless required otherwise by law or separate agreement.
- The most recent **Monitoring and telemetry data values are stored for 24 months**.
- All data is stored in **AWS cloud infrastructure, Frankfurt region (Germany, EU)**.
- No data is transferred outside the EU.

## 4. Support Access & Sharing

- Advantech support personnel may access customer data **only for the purposes of troubleshooting incidents and maintaining service operations**.
- Access is strictly **role-based**.
- The act of access itself is not logged, but **any modifications or changes to customer data are logged**.
- Customers are not automatically notified when support access occurs, but logs of changes are retained.
- Data is not shared with third parties by Advantech.

## 5. Data Access, Portability & Sharing by the User

- Customers retain **full ownership and control** of the data generated by their devices.
- Customers may **retrieve their data at any time** through the available API interface or export functions.
- Data exports are provided **free of charge, without undue delay, and in commonly used, machine-readable formats (e.g., CSV, JSON)**.
- Customers may share their data with third parties, either:
    - by granting access through the standard interfaces provided by WADMP (API, export), or
    - by exporting the data and transmitting it themselves.
- No dedicated third-party interface beyond the standard mechanisms is provided.

## 6. Security & Confidentiality

- Data in transit is encrypted; stored data is protected in line with **AWS Frankfurt regional standards** and **Advantech internal security controls**.
- Confidential information and trade secrets contained in device data are protected and not disclosed.

## 7. Changes to Data Handling

- Customers will be informed in advance of any material changes to the storage region, retention period, or data handling practices.
