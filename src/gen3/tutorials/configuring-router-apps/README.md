# Configuration Profiles - Installing/Upgrading SW of the Device

## Summary

Configuration profiles are used for easy installation of any of our Router Apps, as well as router firmware and its overall settings as individual devices or bunch devices in bulk.

1. First, you must choose an example router that will be used as a default configuration for your Configuration Profile.

2. Connect to your router via IP address to the user GUI.

3. Ensure you're running the latest WebAccess/DMP Client in the Router Apps section so the router is connected with WA/DMP. You can check the Client Release Notes section for the latest version of WA/DMP.
