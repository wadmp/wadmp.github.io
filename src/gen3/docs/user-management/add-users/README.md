## Add Users

### Create New Users

- **Overview:**
  Creating users is the primary method to add them to your companies. When a user is invited, the process differs based on whether they are an **existing user** or a **new one**:

- **New User:**
  Will receive a registration link via email, which, upon completion of registration, will not only create their account but also add them to your company.

- **Preconditions:**

  - You must be logged into the platform.
  - You must have permissions to create users, which can be verified by editing your profile and checking for the appropriate permissions.

**Steps to Create a New User:**

- Select the Appropriate Context:

  - Navigate to Users from the Side Menu in the context of the company where you want to add the user.

  - Alternatively, select "Companies" from the Side Menu, choose your desired company, then proceed to invite a user.

- **Initiate User Invitation:**
  - Click the Invite User button located on the right top of the Users or Companies page.

- **Account Registration:**
  - The link directs the invitee to the main page to complete their account setup. The email field is pre-filled from the link and cannot be changed. They must fill up the remaining login data and click the Create Account button.

### Invite Existing Users

- You can invite existing or new users who just created their account to any company you have permission to. You can do it similarly, like when creating a new user.
