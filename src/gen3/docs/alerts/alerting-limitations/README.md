## Alerting Limitations

<font size="4">Alerts are subject to the following limitations:</font>

- **Availability:**
  Alerts are only available to companies with a Premium subscription.

- **Permission Restrictions:**
  Users must have appropriate permissions to create, manage, and view alerts and their histories.

- **Endpoint Requirements:**
  An alert must have at least one active endpoint to send notifications; otherwise, it will only be recorded in the history.

- **Configuration Sensitivity:**
  Alerts depend heavily on correct configuration settings, such as the target type, parameters, and rule criteria.

- **Historical Data Retention:**
  Alerts are not automatically deleted from history and require manual management to maintain a clear record.
