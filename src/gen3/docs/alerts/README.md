# Alerts

Alerts are a **Premium** feature only available for companies with a Premium subscription.

**To receive notifications when an alert is triggered, you need to set up notification endpoints first. It's possible to have an Alert without an Endpoint and only check the Alerts History in DMP.**

- **Permissions are required to interact with Alerts:**
  - View permission for reading Alerts History, Rules, and Endpoints.
  - Manage permission to create or modify Rules and Endpoints and to mark alerts as read/unread
