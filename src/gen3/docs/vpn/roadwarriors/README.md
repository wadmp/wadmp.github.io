# Roadwarriors

Roadwarriors refer to a VPN configuration designed for mobile users (Windows, Android, macOS, iOS, Linux and basically any device where [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) can be installed) who need secure remote access to a private network from various locations. Unlike site-to-site VPNs, which connect fixed networks, a Roadwarrior setup allows individual devices with dynamic IP addresses to establish encrypted connections over untrusted networks, such as public Wi-Fi or mobile data. This approach ensures secure access to corporate resources, protects sensitive data, and enhances online privacy.

- On Roadwarriors page, you can manage VPN Roadwarriors in your company. Navigate to VPN - Roadwarriors section in menu.

- Add your Roadwarrior by clicking the **ADD ROADWARRIOR** button.
