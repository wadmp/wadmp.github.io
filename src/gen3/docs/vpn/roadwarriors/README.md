# Roadwarriors

Roadwarriors refers to a VPN configuration designed for mobile users who need secure remote access to a private network from various locations. Unlike site-to-site VPNs, which connect fixed networks, a Roadwarrior setup allows individual devices with dynamic IP addresses to establish encrypted connections over untrusted networks, such as public Wi-Fi or mobile data. This approach ensures secure access to corporate resources, protects sensitive data, and enhances online privacy.

- Start by navigating to the VPN section in the Context Panel, then select the Roadwarriors section.
