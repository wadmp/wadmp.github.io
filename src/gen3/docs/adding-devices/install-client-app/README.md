## Install/Upgrade a WebAccess/DMP Client App

If you want to migrate your device from 2.x.x instance, you need to upgrade the Router App to 3.x.x version via 2.x.x WebAccess/DMP Instance - go to [Migration from 2.x.x to 3.x.x Instance](../../migration/). <!-- new link -->

If you do not have the WebAccess/DMP Router App client installed, or you are not sure if you have the client installed, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Check for the Installed client Router App:

- Log in to your router's web interface (the default IP is 192.168.1.1 on the ETH0 local interface).
- Navigate to Customization > Router Apps in the menu.

::: tip ðŸ“Œ Note:
If you see the WebAccess/DMP Client Router App installed, it should be able to connect to the WebAccess/DMP instance. Check the version and upgrade to the latest one if necessary (recommended). You can upgrade directly from WebAccess/DMP by selecting managed version on Desired Configuration tab on device page, or apply Configuration Profile with desired Client App version for multiple devices.
