The results of the import will be displayed after the process completes, which depends on the volume of data. This will include an overview of successful imports, skipped items, and any failures.

You can examine the outcome of the import process. Skipped items indicate they were previously imported or manually added. For any failures, select the number of failed items to investigate the reasons. You can also generate a CSV failure report using the export icon at the top.
