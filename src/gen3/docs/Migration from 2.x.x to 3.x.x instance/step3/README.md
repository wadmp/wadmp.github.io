## Step 3: Migrate Devices

To manage your devices in the 3.x.x instance , upgrade the _wadmp_client_ Router App on your devices to version 3.0.0 using the 2.x.x instance.

Installing this updated Router App version enables your devices to connect to the 3.x.x instance. Note that after this upgrade, devices will no longer be able to connect to the 2.x.x instance. It is advisable to test this migration process on a small number of devices first.
