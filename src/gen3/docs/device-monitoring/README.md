# Device Monitoring

Every device is connected to the WebAccess/DMP instance via the WebAccess/DMP Client Router App, which, by default, sends monitoring data to the instance every 15 minutes.

- **Data Sent**: The data sent is based on your [Fields](../device-management/fields/) settings.
- **Frequency**: The frequency of data sending is based on the Client Router App settings.

Monitoring data can be:

- Interpreted on the company Dashboard as Stats, Charts, or in the Table (for company/filtered in View), or individually per device on the Device Page Monitoring tab.
- Used as a trigger for [Alerts](../alerts/).
- Exported to a [CSV file](./exporting-data-to-csv/).
