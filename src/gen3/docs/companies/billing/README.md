### VPN Billing Summary ###

- Premium companies are charged a fixed rate per GB of data, along with an additional charge per device. In the Parent Company settings under Companies → Edit, a data limit is defined for the entire company structure, including all subcompanies. Each subcompany, including the parent company, can independently purchase additional data (VPN Overview → Buy Data). These purchases count toward the overall data limit and are billed accordingly.

- Data is billed as a one-time charge in the month of purchase and remains available until fully consumed → it does not expire at the end of the billing cycle.

- Roadwarrior VPN users are billed in the same manner as devices, with a fixed charge per user.
