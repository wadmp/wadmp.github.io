### Persistence Of Audit Logs

* **1. Default Display and Retention**

   * Initial Display: By default, only the last 24 hours of audit logs are shown immediately.

   *Retention Policy: Audit logs are retained on the DMP platform for two months. Logs older than two months are automatically purged.

* **2. Viewing Older Logs**

   * Custom Time Selection: To access logs older than the default 24-hour display but within the two-month retention period, use the time selection feature at the top of the audit logs page to adjust the displayed time range.
