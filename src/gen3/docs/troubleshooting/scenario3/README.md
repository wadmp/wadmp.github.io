# Scenario 3

## Scenario 3: Failure Post-Bootstrap

- **Problem:**

  - The router successfully connects to the Bootstrap Server, completing the Bootstrap Server process, but it fails to connect to the Management Server.

- **Potential Causes and Solutions:**

  1.  **Firewall Blockage:** A firewall may be preventing the router from connecting to the Internet.

  2.  **Incorrect Time Setting:** The router's time may differ significantly from the server's, causing issues with the certificate's validity. Ensure the router's time is correctly set.
