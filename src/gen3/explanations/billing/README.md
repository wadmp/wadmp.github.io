# Billing Explained 

## Types of Companies

After a new company is created, the company type is automatically set to "Free". 
Company type can be:

| Company type |   | Features     |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Free | ![Free company type](./free-1.png) | Can claim and manage up to 5 devices.     |
| Premium | ![Premium company type](./premium-1.png)        | Can claim and manage an unlimited number of devices and use the API. Billed monthly.    |



Company type can be changed only for the parent company. Child companies inherit the type from their parent.

## Request Upgrade to Premium

To request the change to Premium, go to the Companies list (in the context menu) and click on your parent company, then in the company menu click on the crown icon with "upgrade" on it.

## Request Downgrade from Premium

To downgrade a Premium account to Free, you need to release all devices which exceed a total amount of 5 and send a request for downgrading to [wadmp@advantech.com](mailto:wadmp@advantech.com).
