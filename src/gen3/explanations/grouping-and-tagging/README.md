# Devices Tagging

You can filter and overview the devices using tags. Using tags, you can create overlapping bunches of devices.

## Tagging

Tagging can make it easier to find the devices by giving them specific properties with tags and then filtering or searching for them.

After logging in to the [system](https://wadmp3.com), you must ensure a *Tag - Textual* field in the Filter Panel of the Devices.

If you don't have it, you can add this field by doing the following:

1. Head into the *Title Panel* and select *Fields*.
2. In the *Fields section*, select "Add".
3. In the *Add Field* form, search for *Tag - Textual*.
4.  You must fill in the *Tag Name* name at least three chars long, *Display name* can be left blank.
5.  Click the "Save" button.

2. Make sure that the Tag - Textual is visible.

Select your desired devices to create a Tag for your device and click the *Batch Edit Filtered Devices* icon.
