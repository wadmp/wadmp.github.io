# Devices Tagging

You can filter and overview the devices using tags. Using tags, you can create overlapping bunches of devices.

## Tagging

Tagging can make it easier to find the devices by giving them specific properties with tags and then filtering or searching for them.

After logging in to the [system](https://wadmp3.com), you need to ensure a *Tag - Textual* field in the Filter Panel of the Devices.

If you don't have it, you can add this field by doing the following:

1. Head into the *Title Panel* and select *Fields*.
2. In the *Fields section*, select "Add".
3. In the *Add Field* form, search for *Tag - Textual*.
4.  You have to fill in *Tag Name* name at least 3 char long, *Display name* can be left blank.
5.  Click "Save" button.
