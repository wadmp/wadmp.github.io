# Devices Tagging

You can filter and overview the devices using tags. Using tags, you can create overlapping bunches of devices.

## Tagging

Tagging can make it easier to find the devices by giving them specific properties with tags and then filtering or searching for them.

After logging in to the [system](https://wadmp.com), you need to ensure a TagString field in the Filter Panel of the Devices.

1. Head into the Title Panel and select Fields.
2. In the Fields section, select "add".
