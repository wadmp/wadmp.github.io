# Adding devices

##	1. Register a device (on-premises only)

In the on-premises version of our system, administrators must register devices before they can be added. This process is necessary because on-premises installations lack access to our manufacturing database, which is utilized for device registration in the public instance. Here's how administrators can register a device:

1. **Accessing Device Registration:**
   - Navigate to the dashboard interface.
   - Click on the "+" icon located above the dashboard table.

2. **Registration Process:**
   - Upon clicking the "+" icon, administrators will be directed to the device registration interface.
   - Administrators will notice an additional tab labeled "Create Device."
   - Fill in the required details about the device in this tab.

3. **Required Information:**
   - During the registration process, administrators must provide comprehensive details about the device being registered. This may include:
     - Device name
     - Serial number
     - Model
     - Location
     - Configuration details
     - Other relevant information

4. **API Endpoint:**
   - Additionally, administrators have the option to register devices programmatically using the API endpoint designated for device registration.

By following these steps, administrators can efficiently register devices in the on-premises version of our system, ensuring seamless integration and management within their environment.

##	2. Claim a device
