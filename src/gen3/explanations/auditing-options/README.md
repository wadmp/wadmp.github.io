# Auditing Explained 

By default, just the last 24 hours of Audit Logs are shown. Audit Logs are stored on DMP for two months back in time (you can filter by time selection at the top). Audit Logs older than two months are forgotten.
There are more places where you can find Audit Logs on DMP:

## Overall Audit Logs

The "Audit Logs" menu item contains overall Audit Logs. You can view all of them (for Devices, Users, and the server) based on your permissions.

## Device Audit Logs
