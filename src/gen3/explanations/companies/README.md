###	Introduction to companies

* **Company Creation:** 
   * When registering on WADMP for the first time, enter your company details to create a company. You automatically become the administrator of this newly created company. Alternatively, an existing company's administrator can add you to their company.

* **User and Company Management:**
   * Once registered, you can create users, assign them to companies, and set their permissions. You can also create additional companies and assign users to these companies.

* **system Adminstrator:**

   * The System Administrator is the administrator of the platform. In addition to the standard permissions, the Sysadmin can also Register and Delete devices and claim devices to any company.
   * Contact your Sysadmin if you have any issues that your company administrator cannot resolve.

###	Limitations of non-premium companies


* After a new company is created, the company type is automatically set to "Free".


* **Company type can be:**

| Company type |   | Features     |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
