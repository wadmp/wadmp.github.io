# Overview

Welcome to the API documentation. Our API offers a **REST** interface with **JSON** responses, making it easy to integrate with your applications.

The API provides full access to all the functionality available in the UI â€” whether you need to retrieve data, create or update resources, or automate workflows. Anything you can do in the UI can be accomplished through the API as well.

Most requests require **OAuth 2.0 authentication**. Please make sure to include a valid access token with your requests.  
See the [Authentication](./authentication/README.md) page for more details.
