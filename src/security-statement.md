We adhere to strict internal company procedures to secure user accounts, including storing salted hashes of passwords and employing standardized user management practices. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is available, adding an extra layer of security to user access.

## WebAccess DMP Security Development Process

Security is deeply embedded in the development of WebAccess DMP, ensuring that each update and feature release meets stringent security standards. Our approach to security in software development encompasses the following key stages:

1. Ongoing Security Education – Our development teams continuously engage in security education, mastering secure coding techniques, threat identification, and vulnerability management to stay ahead of evolving security challenges.

2. Security-Driven Design – During the design phase, we collaborate with security experts to establish clear security criteria, such as encryption methods, input validation, and access control protocols. This ensures potential vulnerabilities are identified early and mitigated effectively.

3. Proactive Development & Implementation – Security is integrated from the start. Our code undergoes rigorous automated scans and manual reviews throughout development to detect and address vulnerabilities in real-time, ensuring robust security at every step.

4. Comprehensive Testing & Feedback – We carry out focused internal security audits and, when appropriate, engage independent specialists for targeted penetration testing. Insights from these reviews inform updates to our security guidelines and help us address identified issues promptly.
