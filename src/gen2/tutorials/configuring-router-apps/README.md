# Installing/Upgrading Router Apps

Router Apps can extend the features of the device above the firmware features.

1. Select the device,
2. click on "Router Apps."
3. There is Router App installed.
4. There is no way to edit properties of yellow (unknown) Router Apps because they are not supported by the platform yet. When the platform knows the App, but the version in the device is not known, it is also yellow - you can reinstall it with a known version.

To keep a specific Router App and version in the device, pin it.
Pinned Router app will always be synced in the device - if the Router App is deleted or updated locally in the device, it will be installed back to pinned version immediately when synced with DMP again.

Firmware can be pinned the same way.
