# Tagging and Grouping

You can filter and overview the devices using groups and tags. The difference between groups and tags is that the device can be only in one group at a time. So changing the group will move the device to another group. But using tags, you can create overlapping bunches of devices. This is because the device can have only one group but multiple tags.

## Grouping
There are two options, how to group certain routers to be overviewed as a group.

### Option 1

After logging in to the [system](https://wadmp.com), click on "My Devices".
