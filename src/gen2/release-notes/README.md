# 2.5.6: August 1, 2024

### Improvements:

- Small internal changes to how billing operates that will not directly affect users of DMP.

### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed services becoming stuck in a broken state when reaching their memory limit. Now the system restores them to a functional state without a manual intervention.
