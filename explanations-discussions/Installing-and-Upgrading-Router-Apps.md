4. There is no way to edit properties of yellow (unknown) Router Apps, because they are not supported by the platform, yet. When the App is known by the platform, but the version is not known, it is also yellow - you can reinstall it with known version.

If we want to keep a specific update, pin it.
if  we try to upgrade or unisntall the pinned Router App locally in the device, it will be installed back to pinned version immediately when connected to DMP again. You can also pin Firmware the same way.
