# Auditing Explained 

By default, just the last 24 hours of Audit Logs are shown. Audit Logs are stored on DMP for two months back in time (you can filter by time selection at the top). Audit Logs older than 2 months are forgotten.
There are more places where you can find Audit Logs on DMP:

## Overall Audit Logs

"Audit Logs" menu item contains overall Audit Logs. You can view all of them (for Devices, Users, the server) based on your permissions.

## Filtering of Audit Logs

You can filter Audit Logs at the top part of the table. These filtering options are available (where applicable):

* Company - One or more companies can be chosen in the filter above the Audit Logs table.
* Time - Start and End times can be set by the pickers above the table. The last 24 hours are set by default. Two months back is allowed as older data are forgotten.
* Action Types - Specific types of tracked actions can be selected here.
* Device MAC - When looking for a particular device in Audit Logs, the MAC address of the device can be put here.
