# Billing Explained 

## Types of Companies

After a new company is created, the company type is automatically set to "Free". 
Company type can be:

| Company type |   | Features     |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Free | ![Free company type](/images/explanations-discussions/billing/free.png) | Can claim and manage up to 5 devices.     |
| Premium | ![Premium company type](/images/explanations-discussions/billing/premium.png)        | Can claim and manage an unlimited number of devices and use the API. Billed monthly.    |



Company type can be changed only for parent company. Child companies inherit the type from their parent.
