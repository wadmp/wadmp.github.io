1. Tag name
2. select company
3. Click "Save"

To assign the tag we created to the device we want, proceed as follows:

1. Click "My Devices"
2. Select company/companies
3. Select devices
4. Click "Set Tags"

![alt text](../images/explanations-discussions/Grouping-and-tagging/TG4.png)

Write the name of the tag we created and click "close"

If we want to find the device under a specific tag, feel free to click on the icon "Filter by Tags"
