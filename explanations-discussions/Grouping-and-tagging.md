# Tagging and Grouping

You can filter and overview the devices using groups and tags. The difference between groups and tags is that the device can be only in one group at a time. Changing of the group will move to device to another group. But using tags you can create overlaping bunches of devices. The device can have only one group but multiple tags.

## Grouping
There are 2 options, how to group certain routers so it can be overviewed as a group.
